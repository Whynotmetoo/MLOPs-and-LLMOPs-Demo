```
### 5. Run the code to train model
```bash
python train_model.py
```
### 6. Configure CI/CD
1.  Create Hugging Face Repo and access token
    - Creat a [new model repo](https://huggingface.co/new) and copy the repo id on the top left corner of the repo, in a format as `your_username/your_model_repo`
    - Go to **Settings > Access Tokens** to generate your token.
2. Create github repository secrets
    - Save the token as a **GitHub Secret** named `HF_TOKEN` and the repo id named `REPO_ID` in your GitHub repository for secure access during deployment. Go the **setting > Actions secrets and variables > Actions** to add your Repository secrets
### 7. push you code
push you code to github and check the pipeline
